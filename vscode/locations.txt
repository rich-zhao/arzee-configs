By default VS Code shows the Settings editor, but you can still edit the underlying settings.json file by using the Open Settings (JSON) command or by changing your default settings editor with the workbench.settings.editor setting.

Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:

    Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
    macOS $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
    Linux $HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json

The workspace settings file is located under the .vscode folder in your root folder.

    Note: In case of a Multi-root Workspace, workspace settings are located inside the workspace configuration file.
